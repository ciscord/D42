All this plus its many 3rd party integrations mean Device42 should be a go-to tool in the DevOps toolbox.</p>
                    <p>When you open a ticket in your ITSM system, Device42 is right there to give you all the information you need. Integrations with many popular ticketing systems allow direct linking of CI to service tickets. Pop up an application dependency diagram to view what users and applications are dependent on a piece of equipment.</p>
                    <p>When planning IP allocations, view network diagrams and fragmentation charts and have your script request the next available IP from Device42 via a call to the RESTful API. DevOps can also leverage the API to easily return a list of software installed on a machine, so both finding instances with versions in need of upgrade, and performing the upgrades can be fully automated</p>
