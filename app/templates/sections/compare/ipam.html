And don't get us started on IPv6 and Excel.  Most importantly, as your network grows due to virtualization and cloud computing, it usually becomes next to impossible to keep the spreadsheets up to date manually." %}</p>

                <p>{% trans "We built Device42 with powerful auto-discoveries so you don't have to worry about manual entry, manual pinging, and/or your data ever being stale." %}</p>
                <p>{% trans "On top of that, we added awesome core features like simple interface, powerful reporting, without having to navigate a maze of features you don't need." %}</p>
