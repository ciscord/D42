                        <p>Hi, this is Marc from Device42. In this video we will review navigation, so let's get
                            started. Here is a list of all devices, you can see high level information about each device
                            - on the right side, youâ€™ll see an Add button, below the Add button, you will see a set of
                            filters. Next we have bulk actions, bulk actions can be performed on any number of items in
                            the list. And last, we have the Search. You will see these same navigation components
                            throughout the system, making it much easier to learn.</p>

                        <p>Continuing with navigation...you can click on an individual device to see details. Here you
                            see the type of physical device, service level, hardware, asset and serial #'s and notes. In
                            Device42, we use hardware templates. The benefit is not having to enter the data each time
                            you create a device, e.g.: you may have the ten servers of the same make and model, you
                            enter the information once, creating a hardware template that can be used for all devices
                            with the same make and model. As you can see here, this device is an Optiplex 910 mini
                            tower. On the hardware view page, you can see information pertaining to it, as well as
                            existing devices of the same make and model.</p>

                        <p>Moving on, let's review the four tabs of details. On the properties tab, you can see basic
                            hardware information such as processor, memory, and hard drives. Next you can see operating
                            system information, and if applicable, rack info. Then we have MAC address and VLAN
                            information - IP address and subnet info, navigate directly to any of these to view the
                            details. Finally, we have device alias.</p>

                        <p>On the Hardware Tab, you can assign components from inventory to a device.</p>

                        <p>The Asset Life Cycle Management Tab enables you to track purchase information such as service
                            contracts and purchase orders. Record and track related tasks; as you can see here, we are
                            tracking purchase, receiving, and deployment dates. These are user-defined types, you can
                            configure these to meet your needs. Finally, you can assign asset tag profiles, and view and
                            print asset tags in QR format.</p>

                        <p>The Other Tab has a place to store device URLs for quick and convenient access. Also on this
                            page you can record PDU, patch panel, and switch port information, upload file attachments,
                            and create any custom data you want to enter in the form of Key Value Pairs.</p>

                        <p>This concludes the Device42 Navigation video, thanks for watching!</p>
